# **Mission:** 
To create a community thats fosters non-toxing gaming experiences, and gives members of all levels of the community opportunities to be involved in the creative discussions and processes. Our community is open to all types and is not restricted to any games. Our only requirement is that you can be respectful to yourself and others.

# **Goal:** 
To create a collaborative community experience which reward players for not engaging in toxic behavior, and dissuade or isolating those who do not. Laying the foundation for our community to be self-governed in a way that griefers or toxic players will be persuaded to change or will not want to stick around.

# **Who's driving?** 
You've got the keys. The entire community, from conception to when you are reading this, has been driven by its members. Every decision, from the name of the discord channels, to the admin/mod structure has been, and will be decided upon by the community. 

# **Community Structure:**
Every member's voice is considered. Every suggestion or bit of feedback (whether negative or positive) is very important to us. Changes to the server are made in consensus, and we have a strict change policy, which intends to provide visibility to anybody into the efforts put into growth and development of the community.
We frequently run polls to vote on changes or new direction, and every member is encouraged to use !suggest in Discord to provide input.

# **Moderators:**
 The role of our moderators is not to enforce the rules upon the community, but act as an extension of its members. While moderators and administrators have the right to use their own discretion while interpreting the rules in order to perform their tasks, these rules are ultimately defined by the community members themselves. Common-sense limitations against objectionable, hateful or toxic actions will be enforced, but moderatior and administrator actions are open to community review.
